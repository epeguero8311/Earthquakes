# Release #1 - Internal Summary

## What We Built

Release #1 lays the foundation for our university course management system. We've got the core structure in place with user accounts, course creation, and basic scheduling functionality.

---

## The Big Picture

We now have a working system where:
- Students, professors, and admins can sign up and log in
- Admins can create courses and manage student schedules
- Students can view their info and make basic updates
- Everything saves to flat files in a structured database

---

## What Actually Got Done

### 1. Account System (Java)
Status: Complete 

The signup flow is fully working:
- Students can create accounts with their info (name, classification, major)
- Professors and admins need a PIN to sign up (security feature)
- Every account gets a unique ID (900s for students, 700s for professors, 800s for admins)
- All accounts save to Database/Accounts.txt

The system gives you 3 attempts to enter the PIN correctly before shutting down. No more brute forcing!

### 2. Login & Routing (Python)
Status: Complete

The main menu (Driver.py) handles everything:
- Sign up redirects to the Java program
- Login checks your ID prefix and routes you to the right menu
- Students go to student menu, admins go to admin menu
- Professors, hasn't been compelted.

### 3. Course Management System
Status: Complete

The Course class is pretty robust:
- Auto-generates unique CRNs (5-digit course reference numbers)
- Tracks course name, time, and enrolled students
- Can add/remove students from courses
- Saves course info to individual text files in Database/courses
- Can search courses by CRN or course name

### 4. Admin Portal
Status: Mostly Complete

Admins have 6 menu options:

1. Create Course - Fully working. Admins input course details, and it saves everything to the database.
2. View Student Schedule - Fully working. Enter a student's 900 number and see their classes.
3. View Admin Info - Fully working. Shows admin ID and name.
4. Create Student Schedule - Fully working. Can create schedules for multiple students in one session.
5. Edit Student Schedule - Fully working. Add or remove courses from student schedules by CRN.
6. Exit - Works.

All the core admin functions are there. They can create courses, build student schedules from scratch, and modify them as needed.

### 5. Student Portal
Status: Complete 

Students have 4 menu options:

1. View Info - Shows their student number, name, classification, major, and fiscal clearance status
2. Change Major - Updates their major
3. Check Fiscal Clearance - See if they're cleared to register
4. Exit - Logs out


### 6. Database Structure
Status: Complete 

We've got a clean file-based database:

Database/
├── Accounts.txt              (all users)
├── Courses.csv               (course reference)
├── Security_Pins.txt         (PINs for prof/admin signup)
├── University_Database.csv   (ID registry)
└── courses/                  (individual course files)
    ├── Comp Sci.txt
    ├── Math 101.txt
    └── ...

Everything saves properly and loads back when you log in.

## What's Missing 

### Professor Functionality
Status: Not Started 

The login system recognizes professors (700 IDs), but there's no professor menu or driver. Right now, professors just get a "Welcome Professor!" message and then... nothing. 

This was supposed to be handled by other team members, but it didn't happen for Release #1.

### What Professors Should Be Able to Do:
- View their assigned courses
- See enrolled students
- Change course times
- Drop students from their courses

## File Structure

Here's what we're working with:

Main Files:
- Driver.py - Main entry point
- SignUp.java - Account creation
- Functions.py - Helper functions

Admin Files:
- Admin.py - Admin class
- admin_driver.py - Admin menu
- load_admin.py - Load admin from database
- Course.py - Course management

Student Files:
- Student.py - Student class
- student_driver.py - Student menu
- load_student.py - Load student from database`

---

Bottom Line: Release #1 delivered a working foundation for course management. Two out of three user types are fully functional, and the groundwork is there for professors once that gets implemented.
